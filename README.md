## Hi, I’m Emily Lee 🦥😇

I’m passionate about uncovering the stories hidden in data and turning those insights into meaningful actions. My journey in data analytics has been driven by curiosity, creativity, and a desire to solve complex problems.

I’m currently exploring how data analytics, software development, and AI can come together to make an impact. Leading a team of talented engineers and analysts, I’m learning every day while building tools that solve real-world challenges—like tracking carbon emissions, diagnosing diseases, and empowering small businesses. 

## What I’m Up To
🔭 I currently oversee **4 interdisciplinary projects** that combine **data analytics, software development, and AI technologies**:
- **Disease Diagnosis Tool**: A lightweight, symptom-based matching system for diagnosing dairy cow diseases for farmers in India.
- **AI Vision Project**: Applying computer vision to analyze and classify banana conditions for banana farmers.
- **Carbon Emission Tool**: An analytics platform for calculating Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to help businesses track and reduce their environmental impact.
- **MSME Marketing Tool**: A recommendation system designed to optimize marketing strategies for small and medium-sized enterprises.

🌱 Currently learning more about **advanced analytics tools** like Power BI and Alteryx.  

## Tools I Use
- 🛠️ Python, SQL, Tableau, RStudio
- 🌐 Notion, Asana, Jira
- 🖍️ Canva
